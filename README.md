## Overview

`media.fs` is a low-level utility library for the **SmartMediaFiles ecosystem**. It provides a set of functions to interact with the file system in a reliable and cross-platform manner. It offers a comprehensive abstraction for file metadata, allowing seamless operations across different operating systems.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support:** Utilizes build tags to provide OS-specific implementations for file operations.
- **File Metadata Abstraction:** Implements a `FileInfo` interface that extends the standard Go `fs.FileInfo`.
- **Path Verification:** Includes functions to check if a path points to a file (`IsFile`) or a directory (`IsDir`).
- **Content-Check:** Includes a function to check if a file or directory is empty (`IsEmpty`).
- **Path Resolution:** Includes a function to resolve a path to an absolute path, expanding tildes `~` and evaluating symbolic links (`Resolve`).

## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/smartmediafiles/media.fs/fs
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `media.fs` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/smartmediafiles/media.fs/fs"
)

func main() {
	// Resolve a path
	resolvedPath, err := fs.Resolve("~/your-file.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// On error, it's likely the file doesn't exist
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Absolute Path: %s\n", resolvedPath)

	// Get file information
	info, err := fs.NewFileInfo(resolvedPath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error:", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Name:", info.Name())
	fmt.Println("Title:", info.Title())
	fmt.Println("Extension:", info.Ext())
	fmt.Println("Path:", info.Path())
	fmt.Println("Absolute Path:", info.Abs())
	fmt.Println("Size (bytes):", info.Size())
	fmt.Println("Is Directory:", info.IsDir())
	fmt.Println("Creation Time:", info.CreationTime())
	fmt.Println("Last Access Time:", info.LastAccessTime())
	fmt.Println("Last Write Time:", info.LastWriteTime())
}
```
